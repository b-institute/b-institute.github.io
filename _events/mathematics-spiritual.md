**Course Synopsis:** Mathematics is an unbelievable gift for all of us, as in the words of renowned physicist Eugene Wigner, “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences” – from physics and biological systems to unknown areas of cosmos, it allows us to penetrate where our instruments cannot reach. Interestingly, and which is lesser known, that besides algebras, curves and planes, renowned mathematicians also worked seriously from centuries about the question of God – whether He exists and how can this be logically and mathematically established. The present course will highlight those mathematicians and their wonderful thoughts and works, while providing a brief overview of the development and crisis in the Foundations of Mathematics since 5th century B.C.
