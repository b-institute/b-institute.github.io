### _**All India Students’ Conference on Science and Spiritual Quest**_

AISSQ conference is organized by Bhaktivedanta Institute, Kolkata every year in various parts of the country inspiring the young minds towards the synthesis of science and spirituality.
Dr. Singh had lots of concern for the student community with regard to their holistic development. He felt that our younger generation was exposed to the latest scientific and technological developments in various disciplines at numerous colleges and universities around the world, but they lacked spiritual foundation and hence were unable to make proper use of such scientific developments. Therefore, he felt the need to organize a students’ conference on the interface of Science and Spirituality for the holistic growth of their personality. With this vision, Dr. Singh conceptualized the series of “All India Students’ Conference on Science and Spiritual Quest” (AISSQ). He personally organized the first conference in this series in December 2005 in Vrindavan, UP. However, by the will of Providence, Dr. Singh left for the spiritual abode on 2 October 2006.
