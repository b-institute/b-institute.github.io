      <h3 style="text-align:center;">OUR MISSION &amp; VISION</h3>

      <p style="text-align:justify">
        Founded in 1974, the  Bhaktivedanta Institute is a center for Advanced Studies in science and vedanta. As a non-profit organization, it is  dedicated to facilitating communication between scientific and religious communities on a wide range of issues that affect people individually and collectively. It explores foundational questions related to life's origin, the nature of humanity, problems related to the body, mind, and society at large,  as well as many other philosophical and ethical concerns. The Bhaktivedanta Institute aims to provide comprehensive solutions to these issues through a <em>consciousness-based paradigm</em>. This is a new approach that will have profound significance for broadening our understanding of science, spirituality, and their synthesis. One of the primary objectives of the Bhaktivedanta Institute is to present this paradigm for the critical attention of serious scholars and thinkers throughout the world. As such, the institute supports a closer examination of existing scientific paradigms in cosmology, evolution, physics, biology, genetics, neurosciences, environmental science and other sciences. The Bhaktivedanta Institute also promotes scientific, and philosophical dialogues among scientists, scholars and theologians of the world. These dialogues cover various common conceptual grounds and promote a better understanding amongst different scientific and faith-based communities. They also address issues that emerge due to technological developments and scientific discoveries. The Bhaktivedanta Institute has also collaborated with other organizations such as the URI (United Religious Initiative), Templeton Foundation, Metanexus Institute and many other organizations around the world to address issues of common interests. To fulfill its objectives, the Institute  supports the exchange of ideas through conferences, seminars, publications, and its website. We invite you to browse our website, subscribe to our email updates, and attend our events.
