##### **EDITORIAL**

Dear Readers, It  is  our  great  pleasure  to  bring  forth  this  ninth  volume  of  our  journal Savijïänam — Scientific Exploration for a Spiritual Paradigm. The articles featured in  this  volume  are  thought  provoking as  they  address  various  challenging questions for humanity. Ethics and values are integral part of our life. In recent times, the profound questions in bioethics are attracting people from different disciplines to seek for the right answers.

The first article in this volume presents a  stimulating  dialogue  on  bioethics,  science  of  life  and spirituality  between Prof. Arthur A. Caplan, Drs. William F. and Virginia Connolly Mitty Professor of Bioethics  at  New  York  University's  Langone  Medical  Center  and  Dr.  T.  D. Singh, Founder-Director, Bhaktivedanta Institute, Kolkata, India. The dialogue brings-forth  how  the  bioethical  issues  like  abortion,  euthanasia, cloning,  etc., are becoming essential to discuss globally with advancement of technology. It has also been discussed that spiritual wisdom can contribute to ethical views by enlightening on the essence of life, its meaning and purpose.

The next article, “The Search for the Perfect Language” by Gregory John Chaitin, Federal University, Rio de Janeiro, is bound to fascinate the minds of the readers as  it  talks  about  the  prospect of  finding  the  perfect  language  with  which  this world  could  have  been  algorithmically  programmed. This  mathematical  idea is  similar  to  physicists`  attempt  to  find  a  foundational  “Theory  of Every-thing” in physics. Initially the author presents a broad sweep of the history of mathematical logic based on the revolutionary works of Raymond Lull, Leibniz, Huygens, Hilbert, Cantor, Bertrand Russel, von Neumann, GÎdel, Turing, etc. Though  the  mathematicians  have  been  trying  to  find  a  perfect  language  and a  perfect  formal  axiomatic  theory  for  all  of  mathematical  truths,  they found that incompleteness of such a formalization,  algorithmic  irreducibility  and algorithmic randomness are limiting them.

Christoph Benzmüller,  Department  of  Mathematics  and  Computer  Science, FU Berlin, Germany & CSLI/Cordula Hall, Stanford University, CA, USA and Bruno Woltzenlogel Paleo, College of Engineering and Science, ANU, Canberra,Australia  jointly  present  the  third  article  on  “Experiments  on  Computational Metaphysics: GÎdel's Proof of God's Existence”. The article presents a glimpse of their work supported by automated theorem provers on Kurt GÎdel's ontological argument for the existence of God. This work shows that existence of God is not a mere assumption, but a foundational truth
