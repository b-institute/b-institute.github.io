##### **EDITORIAL**

We are pleased to bring forth this eighth volume of our journal Savijñānam. This issue aims at exploring the most important aspects of our existence: consciousness and free will. No human being can imagine his existence without being conscious or without having a will of his own. In spite of the fact that the presence of conscious experience is so compelling, it has been one of the major unsolved mysteries in the modern science. Attempts from various fields of science, philosophy, psychology, etc., have not been successful enough to present a convincing and well-formed theory of consciousness. On the other hand, in the religious traditions, consciousness and free will are considered as the fundamental characteristics of all life forms. Perhaps, with the advancing scientific age, one day we might recognize them to be so, thereby giving new dimensions to the study of the science of life. It is quite conceivable that in this exploration, foundational ideas held in religious traditions may play a vital role. Further, ethics and values of life, which are integral part of every religion, will also become important in this study.

Singh and mathematician Prof. J. N. Srivastava. The discussion touches upon topics like the nature of mind and consciousness in religious traditions as well as in neuroscience, and the need for respect and care towards other forms of life.

**David Hodgson**, Supreme Court Judge, New South Wales, Australia.

Dr. David Hodgson, former Judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Australia expresses his deep concern over responsibility and freewill. Presenting the limitations of modern physical science and neuroscience to explain conscious experience, he supports the possibility that science can accommodate free will. He goes further to conclude that even though genetic and environmental influences play a role in shaping our character and conduct, they do not completely dispense us with responsibility, for nature leaves us with the capacity to make decisions and take actions.

**Amit Goswami, Ph.D.**

Eugene, OR 97402, USA

Quantum physicist Prof. Amit Goswami from the Center for Quantum Activism, Eugene, USA, suggests a paradigm shift to science within consciousness. This new science — fundamentally based on the proposal of the existence of a universal consciousness — attempts to eliminate several paradoxical situations in the present quantum theory. The author reasons that the new science will avoid the possibility of dogma by bringing in the notion of creative freedom.

Founder Director, Bhaktivedanta Institute
Founder President, Vedanta and Science Educational Research Foundation

Dr. T. D. Singh presents the Vedantic perspective on the nature of consciousness. Drawing from his interactions with prominent scientists and leaders of the world, he begins by surveying the area of research and highlighting salient developments while also recognizing the shortcomings and deficiencies of the theories to explain observable phenomena. This is followed by an introduction to the ancient Vedantic insights about consciousness.
