A dialogue between Prof. William D. Phillips and Dr. T. D. Singh on “Laser Cooling of Atoms and the Role of a Personal God.” Prof. Phillips received the 1997 Nobel Prize in Physics for using lasers to cool and trap neutral atoms, which paved the way for scientists to design more precise atomic clocks and to create the highly astonishing Bose-Einstein condensate. This conversation was held at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Gaithersburg, USA on June 11, 2005, after official working hours

Prof. Amit Goswami from the University of Oregon, Eugene, USA proposes a new science based on the primacy of consciousness. The author puts forth four profound examples that attempt to illustrate the validity of the existence of God – Quantum Measurement, Biological Evolution, Perception and Mind-body Healing. Based on this new paradigm which is grounded in quantum physics, he simultaneously endeavors to resolve various paradoxical features such as creativity, fossil gaps, the riddle of perception and rapidly growing mind-body healing which our existing scientific conceptions find hard to explain.

Prof. Townes is one of the greatest 20th-century scientists whose investigations into the properties of microwaves resulted first in the maser, a device which amplifies electromagnetic waves, and later into his co-invention of the laser, which amplifies and directs light waves into parallel direct beams. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1964.
