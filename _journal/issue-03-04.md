##### **EDITORIAL**

Dear Readers, 
We  are  happy  to  present  this  new  issue  of  our  journal  Savijnanam-Scientific Exploration for a Spiritual Paradigm. This issue is the third and fourth volumes combined.  You  may  find  that  the  articles included  in  this  issue  are  thought-provoking covering profound issues ranging from the nature of physical reality to the nature of God. Since  antiquity,  many  prominent  thinkers  of  the  world,  for  example, Plato  to Tagore,  Newton  to  Einstein,  have  explored  to  unveil  the  nature  of  reality.  But reality  always seems  deeper  than  our  feeble  minds  can  comprehend.  Could  a combined effort of science and spirituality help to deepen our understanding of the nature of reality?

The first article in this issue, “Science, Spirituality and the Nature of Reality” is a dialogue with Prof. Roger Penrose, a world renowned mathematician from the University of Oxford, and it aims to seek some possible answers  to  the  question  of  reality.  Reflecting  on  a  wide  range  of  topics  from consciousness to cosmology and from scientific mystery to mathematical beauty, the dialogue presents useful insights in our quest towards an ultimate reality.

“Quantum  Physics,  Consciousness  and  a  New  Science  of Healing” by Prof. Amit Goswami from the University of Oregon, Eugene, USA depicts an integration of two sciences – Eastern medicine and Western medicine for a more holistic approach to health. Eastern medicine has concentrated on vital body and the creativity of the vital body. On the other hand, Western medicine has focused on mainly the physical body.  In this way we have two systems of medicine, both very good at what they do, but alone neither is the perfect apple of holistic health that holds the key to all cures. The author attempts an integration of the two sciences through “Science within consciousness”, which he proposes on the basis of quantum physics.

“Life Comes from Life, Part IIIA: A Preliminary Discussion on the Theory of Quantum Reality and Consciousness” by Prof. Jagdish Srivastava is in continuation of his series of articles in this journal. Prof.  Srivastava has formulated  a  theory  TK  concerning  the  Foundations  of Reality, which includes Quantum Reality,Consciousness, and Reality in general. He  compares  this  theory  with  eight  other  contemporary  theories of quantum reality and attempts to establish its greater plausibility.

In the last article, “Reality of God’s Existence: Scriptural and Scientific Evidence,” a  humble  attempt  is made  by  us  to  explore  the existence  of  God  based  upon scientific and Vedantic perspectives. The scientific or bottom-up process based on experiments, observations and inferences, can, at the most, indicate the presence of God but cannot provide a deeper knowledge of God. The spiritual or scriptural knowledge or the top-down process could provide deeper insights into the nature and existence of God. Thus a synthesis of the top-down and bottom-up processes or a synthesis of scriptural and scientific approaches for the evidence of God’s existence has been called for in this article. The aphorisms of Vedäntasütra V.S. 1.1.3-4, state that the argument for the existence of God should be based on scriptural evidence. In other words, the scriptures are the authority and deciding factor for the complete knowledge of God, just as a mother’s words are the authority in discerning the true identity of the father. This Vedantic process of acquiring knowledge is called avaroha-panthä in Sanskrit. This means that real knowledge should be received through the  parampara,  the  descending,  or  top-down  process.  On  the  other  hand,  an empirical logic based on experiments, observations and inferences is fundamental to the scientific approach. But it has its own limitations. In Vedanta it is called äroha-panthä  or  jïäna  märga,  the  ascending  path,  or  the  bottom-up  process. This scientific process can, at the most, indicate the existence of God. It cannot lead to a deeper knowledge of God. This is because our senses have four inherent limitations.  Hence,  scientific  knowledge  based  on  one’s  intellect  and  sense perception is incomplete while spiritual knowledge provides deeper insights into the nature and existence of God. In this article the author briefly describes the Vedantic epistemology and presents a synthesis of the top-down and bottom-up processes or a synthesis of scriptural and scientific approaches for the evidence of God’s existence. This is the holistic Vedantic paradigm. Finally, he outlines some fundamental attributes of God and His role in the universe from Vedanta and other Vedic scriptures
