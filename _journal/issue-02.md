The first article of this issue is a dialogue on ‘Science and Spiritual Exploration’ with Professor Charles H. Townes, a Nobel Laureate in Physics from the University of California, Berkeley whose basic researches in the field of experimental physics led  to  the  discovery  of  the  maser  and  laser. According  to  Professor  Townes, Science is a search for truth.  This search will greatly benefit if science is open to spiritual and mystical ideas. The dialogue touches upon some phenomena that do not have satisfactory scientific explanation but can be possibly explained with the help of spiritual/mystical ideas.

The  second  article  entitled,  “Life  Comes  From  Life,  Part  II:  Consciousness, Life, and the Validity of the Bhagavadgétä Ontology” has been contributed by J.  N.  Srivastava,  Professor  of  Statistics  and  Mathematics  from  Colorado  State University. This article is a continuation of his previous article in the first issue. In it he makes an attempt to define life as self-conscious and beyond matter, using logical-mathematical argument and has attempted to connect this definition to the ancient wisdom given in the Bhagavadgétä.

The third article is a dialogue entitled, “Science and Spirituality from a Vedantic Perspective”, with Professor S. K. Mukherjee, a well-known chemist from India. In this article, the need for a new science has been discussed to explain certain fundamental principles of nature such as consciousness. Taking insights from Vedanta, the dialogue suggests that the new science should include spirituality in order to describe reality as well as to decide the ethics of human actions. It should also help in better understanding of a presently widely debated subject such as cloning.

In  the  paper  on  ‘Vedanta  and  Science’,  we  present  our  second  article in the series entitled, “Vedanta and Science – II, A Glimpse of the Origin of the Universe”.  The  article  explores  modern  scientific  theories  in  cosmology  and their  incompleteness  in  describing  the  origin  of  the  universe.  Thereafter, the author presents some interesting features of Vedantic theistic cosmology, which could help cosmologists in their search for the origin of the universe. He further suggests that cosmology should be an important meeting point between science and spirituality.
