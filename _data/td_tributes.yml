- quote: In very lively and friendly discussions we touched scientific and spiritual questions related to the genetics and the evolution of living organisms. These debates benefited from a deep, mutual understanding, in which the importance of devoting particular attention to the interface between scientific knowledge and spirituality was highlighted. While Dr. Singh particularly appreciated my scientifically based views on the process of biological evolution, I enjoyed his spiritual views on traditional wisdom as well as his open-minded readiness to co-integrate on common grounds our knowledge and beliefs in order to improve our humble understanding of the great complexity of life.

- quote: Dr. T.D. Singh was always simple and unassuming. This little man had a big heart in a troubled world, which means that he carried a lot of burdens that most of us chose simply to ignore, but also experienced joys that most of us can only imagine...we honor him by best continuing his work with the same humility, rigor, commitment, and compassion that he exemplified in his life.
