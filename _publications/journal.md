##### **EDITORIAL**

We are pleased to bring forth this eighth volume of our journal Savijïänam. This issue aims at exploring the most important aspects of our existence: consciousness and free will. No human being can imagine his existence without being conscious or without having a will of his own. In spite of the fact that the presence of conscious experience is so compelling, it has been one of the major unsolved mysteries in the modern science. Attempts from various fields of science, philosophy, psychology, etc., have not been successful enough to present a convincing and well-formed theory of consciousness. On the other hand, in the religious traditions, consciousness and free will are considered as the fundamental characteristics of all life forms. Perhaps, with the advancing scientific age, one day we might recognize them to be so, thereby giving new dimensions to the study of the science of life. It is quite conceivable that in this exploration, foundational ideas held in religious traditions may play a vital role. Further, ethics and values of life, which are integral part of every religion, will also become important in this study. The first article in this issue presents an enlivening dialogue on consciousness, environmental ethics and science-spirituality among philosopher Prof. Holmes Rolston, scientist-saint Dr. T. D. Singh and mathematician Prof. J. N. Srivastava. The discussion touches upon topics like the nature of mind and consciousness in religious traditions as well as in neuroscience, and the need for respect and care towards other forms of life. In the second article, Dr. David Hodgson, former Judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Australia expresses his deep concern over responsibility and freewill. Presenting the limitations of modern physical science and neuroscience to explain conscious experience, he supports the possibility that science can accommodate free will. He goes further to conclude that even though genetic and environmental influences play a role in shaping our character and conduct, they do not completely dispense us with responsibility, for nature leaves us with the capacity to make decisions and take actions.

In the third article, quantum physicist Prof. Amit Goswami from the Center for Quantum Activism, Eugene, USA, suggests a paradigm shift to science within consciousness. This new science — fundamentally based on the proposal of the existence of a universal consciousness — attempts to eliminate several paradoxical situations in the present quantum theory. The author reasons that the new science will avoid the possibility of dogma by bringing in the notion of creative freedom.

**T. D. Singh (Henceforth TDS):** Congratulations Prof. Rolston for receiving the Templeton prize!

**Holmes Rolston (Henceforth HR):** Thank you! It came as a surprise; life sometimes has surprising moments. With his Foundation, John Templeton has indeed done a number of pioneering researches and discoveries.

**T. D. Singh (Henceforth TDS):** First time, I saw you at the conference on Science and Spirituality that took place in Bangalore, India.

**Holmes Rolston (Henceforth HR): **Yes, Templeton wanted the events to be more international. So he deliberately had those in India and in Japan, among other countries in Asia. One was in Paris, and I also went to one in Spain.

Place of grace, as a place of wonder, a place that needs to be revered, respected. So, I want to celebrate the value and importance of what has happened on this planet, and I hope that if we do that well here, then the next life will be good. Let me put it this way, sometimes people say, “Do you believe in a life to come, another life?” And I say, well! It seems a little difficult to believe. But let’s remember that if I do find myself living in a next life, that will be less of a miracle than the one that’s already happened. So what I’m saying is, for life to continue in another world doesn’t seem to me to be as miraculous as the fact that once upon a time there was nothing, and this earth, this world was created. For my mind, being here is almost a miracle enough.

**TDS:** Maya, or illusion, is one aspect in our tradition. In Hinduism, there are two main paths, one is called impersonal path (that which propounds impersonal conception of God) and the other is vaiñëava tradition (monotheistic school that reveals Lord Viñëu as the Supreme Personality of Godhead). Vaiñëava tradition explains that this world is a place of tribulation to prepare one for the ultimate journey. In fact, there is a very nice passage in the **Bhagavad-gétä**

**_bahünäà janmanäm ante jïänavän mäà prapadyate väsudevaù sarvam iti sa mahätmä su-durlabhaù_**

It says that after many many cycles of birth and death, when one comes to the human form of life and takes the opportunity to develop one’s knowledge, wisdom and intelligence, one will have the mood of approaching the Lord, surrendering to Him. Such individuals, by their sincere spiritual practice (sadhana), will be promoted to the spiritual world. Therefore, this world is a platform for preparing for the final journey.

I would like to ask you about the concept of the soul in Christianity, especially from the scientific perspective. Most of my Christian friends, priests and paëòits,10 say, according to the Bible – if not misinterpreted (as some of them also suggest) – only humans have souls, other forms of life don’t have. This has troubled me, as all forms of life have souls according to the Vedantic tradition.11 You are also a minister, and I would be glad to hear your opinion.

**HR: **I don’t think that even Hindus think that plants, trees have souls, so there are living things that don’t have souls. I don’t know what you think about insects? I don’t think you think that insects have souls.

why I wanted to find out what is this difference. If we observe some birds, and especially the swan, we acknowledge their intelligence and their feedback. Why wouldn’t they have a soul? You train a bird, establishing a relationship with the bird, the bird also responds. It seems to me to be an area to be explored, common elements in the dialogue between East and West could be useful. Once this is resolved scientifically, personally I think it will be much easier to relate to different cultures.

Vedantic conception of biodiversity — According to Vedic literature, there are 8.4 x 106 varieties of life forms (microorganisms, plants, aquatics, birds, reptiles, animals, humanoids and human beings) categorized on the basis of different degrees of consciousness according to the proportion of association with the mode of goodness, the mode of passion and the mode of ignorance.

**HR:** Yes, we certainly need to interrelate different cultures in today’s world.

**TDS:** I’m impressed with your work on ethics, environmental ethics.12 You point out that we need to respect this entire cosmic nature. You say that we humans are anthropocentric; the perception we have of the world is that we are the most

 ** Why I (still) Believe in free will and responsibility**

It’s widely asserted by scientists and philosophers that our decisions and actions are wholly determined by physical processes of our brains; and many also assert that this means we cannot have free will and cannot, in any real sense, be responsible for what we do. In recent times, this has led to increased questioning of the basis of criminal responsibility,1 suggesting that punishment cannot be deserved and should not be imposed as any kind of retribution, and that the law should be guided solely by consideration of what response to damaging conduct would be most beneficial to society and to the individual concerned.

I too feel the force of reasons supporting these assertions. Science, since the time of Newton, has progressively explained more and more of what happens in the world in terms of laws of nature; and over the last century, these explanations have increasingly been applied to the operations of the human brain. It’s reasonable to believe that our conscious experiences, including visual and auditory experiences, thoughts and feelings, are wholly caused by and correspond to physical processes of our brains; and neuroscience suggests that these same physical processes wholly cause our decisions and actions. However, I believe there are stronger reasons for holding that, while our conscious experiences do correspond with physical processes of our brains, these experiences can themselves have effects beyond those explicable in terms of physical processes and laws of nature, and that this enables us to have free.

It’s widely accepted that the most reliable knowledge comes from application of the scientific method, involving the formulation and testing of hypotheses; but even this method depends heavily on plausible reasoning, in the formulation of hypotheses to be tested, the devising of experiments to test them, and the selection of which unrefuted hypotheses should be provisionally accepted (because while experiments can refute general hypotheses, they cannot prove them to be true). If plausible reasoning could not support reasonable decisions about what to believe, science and philosophy would be impossible.
(3) Plausible reasoning cannot be reduced to any kind of algorithmic process using discovered or invented rules for good reasoning. Arguments of Hume, Popper and others, particularly as developed by the American philosopher Hilary Putnam, show that plausible reasoning cannot be fully explained in terms of rules for good reasoning, whether they be rules of logic or mathematics or probability or whatever. Putnam concluded that human rationality cannot be formalised without formalising complete human personality, and possibly not even then.2
Consistently with this, consciously-held reasons for decisions and actions are often inconclusive, and there is an apparent gap between reasons on the one hand and decisions and actions on the other.3 Hume said we always act in accordance with the preponderance of our desires; but that assumes that desires, like forces in Newtonian physics, are commensurable, so that there is always a single ‘resultant’ desire that can direct our decisions and actions; whereas in truth there is no common scale on which (say) a feeling of hunger can be explicitly weighed against a feeling of obligation to carry out a promised task. If ‘desires’ such as these conflict, the outcome is not determined by any overt preponderance of one over the other (because there can be no preponderance of incommensurables), but by plausible reasoning to a decision that takes account of their different characters.

**Towards a Dogma-free Science: The Restoration of creative intelligence**

Abstract: Dogmaticity in the current paradigm of science (materialist science) is discussed along with the paradigm shift that is taking place to a new dogma-free science (science within consciousness). The old science subverted creative intelligence. It is shown that the new science restores it.

**Introduction**
Modern science was created in a struggle to break away from religious (Christian) dogma. From the get go, it had two prongs: theory and experiment. It was believed that the idea of verifying theory with experimental data should be enough of a guarantee against dogma. However, this is easier said than done. First, it seemed logical that underlying world view assumptions and ideas that cannot be subjected to experimental verification become a religious dogma. So the scientists tried to keep such assumptions at bay. Get real! Keep your theories to what is observable, material universe and the like. This itself, however, is a dogma: the metaphysical dogma of scientific realism as opposed to the metaphysics of idealism (of Plato and the founders of religious/spiritual traditions) where (unverifiable) ideas such as God are recognized as the primary reality. We should be a little humble in deciding among metaphysical alternatives. What is intractable and unquantifiable today becomes tractable tomorrow.

This unification, however, has not entirely followed the Kuhnian script. The unification has been achieved by leaving out major data, sometimes entire phenomena. (Ironically, the spiritual/religious worldview that modern science replaced made the same mistake; it left out any phenomena that did not fit. In its extreme form, it ignored the entire manifest world as illusory because the worldview could not explain it.)
Naturally, there is resistance against this monolithic approach to science. The cultural anthropologists have developed the concept of multiculturalism as a There is enormous academic pressure that all research in these sciences is carried out under the one worldview assumption of scientific materialism. … even the social sciences are under pressure to conform.

way of escaping the tyranny of one monolithic materialist science. The field of psychology is divided into four paradigms: behavioral/cognitive that dominate academia, depth psychology, humanistic psychology, and transpersonal psychology. Only the first conforms to scientific materialism; the other three come with separate worldview assumptions. Depth psychology posits the concept of the unconscious as a source of cause other than material interactions.
Humanistic psychology is adamant upon the causal efficacy of human free will and creativity. Transpersonal psychology operates on the basis of an entirely different worldview (called monistic idealism) that consciousness, not matter, is the ground of all being. And, all three forces of alternative psychology insist that psychology cannot be reduced to neurophysiology; the psyche is an independent arena for the play of reality.
The field of medicine is similarly divided between conventional modern medicine or allopathy and various paradigms of alternative medicine (see figure 2). Only the conventional modern medicine is included in materialist science. All the alternative medicine paradigms have good data behind them; all the paradigms So here is what is paradoxical: how can a possible brain (a possible observer) look at a possible elementary particle and make actuality? Think about it; it can’t. The mathematician von Neumann6 made this into a rigorous mathematical theorem: material interaction can only convert quantum possibilities into other uantum possibility, never actuality.
But of course, measurement does produce actuality a fact that is often called the observer effect. So von Neumann6 suggested that an observer’s consciousness ust be a nonmaterial dual entity. But dualism is not scientific. How does a nonmaterial consciousness interact with matter in order to collapse its possibility packet into actuality? Scientifically speaking, this requires the exchange of a signal. Signals carry energy. But the energy of the material universe alone is always a constant; none of it leaks to the dual world of consciousness!

**Consciousness: Scientific and Vedantic perspectives**

**Introduction**
Since the last few decades, consciousness has emerged as an important field of study in scientific and philosophical disciplines. There is a growing interest to investigate consciousness among quantum physicists, neuro-physiologists, cognitive philosophers and spiritualists. As Prof. Christof Koch, who collaborated with the late Francis Crick, attempting to discover ‘neurobiological basis’ of consciousness, expressed: “Consciousness is one of the major unsolved
problems in science today.” Biologists try to explain consciousness using neuronal activity. Quantum physicists try to explain the collapse of the wave function through some interaction of the mind or consciousness. However, these theories are inadequate to explain consciousness.
In this article, the author presents a glimpse of various scientific attempts and their limitations to comprehend consciousness followed by the ancient Vedantic insights about consciousness.
**Architecture of the Brain**
The human brain has been described as the ‘three-pound universe’, the single most complex system so far iscovered in the entire cosmological realm.
magneto-encephalographic studies. We are now beginning to gain some idea of how the brain processes sensory information through a combination of electrical probing and various types of these scans. Neuroscientists locate synaptic connections in space and time, and plot families of pathways between areas of brain activity. Almost everyday some complexity is uncovered. They go on describing two-way interconnections, simultaneous activations of different areas in brain, as well as the surprising examples of functions taking place in the brain without conscious experience at all, as in famous cases of blind sight, and other clinical surprises. With all these new facts at our disposal, one is naturally tempted to hope that the source of consciousness will finally be deciphered.
Looking at the data from a brain scan, a skilled technician may be able to locate the parts of the brain active during specific mental and motor tasks. A neurologist, knowing the brain terrain and seeing the data output, may be able to tell what the activity was that induced each specific brain lobe to fire For one who knows the visual cortex very well, the data can even reveal if the scene being observed is in color or black and white. But the experience of the vision is something else. The conscious experience escapes the machine’s reading.

interpretations in which the conscious observer collapses the wave function. Thus one common feature among the leading quantum physicists is that they all try to explain the collapse of the wave function through some interaction of the mind or consciousness. However, there are also other scholars who object such a notion.
3. Researchers hope that quantum uncertainty and non-locality could be linked to complex brain states and thus could possibly provide an explanation of our experience of free will. William James, von Neumann, Eugene Wigner, Erwin SchrÎdinger, and David Bohm are some of the pioneers in the study of consciousness.14
Over the recent years, numerous versions of quantum theories of consciousness have been proposed including Eccles’ Psychons, Pribram and Bohm’s Holonomic brain theory, Hameroff and Penrose’s Orch-OR theory, Spin- Mediated Consciousness Theory,15 etc. The literature in this area in growing and we have listed some of the prominent ones in the attached note.16 These theories and many others along these lines use a range of tools such as wave coherence, quantum computation, quantum spin, chaos, non-linear dynamics, fractal dynamics, electrodynamical resonances, etc., and associate them with brain states in an attempt to explain consciousness.

John Eccles, a Nobel Laureate in physiology and medicine who devoted his scientific life to the study of mammalian brain, emphasized the entry of quantum effects into brain dynamics in connection with effects at nerve terminals. He explained it elaborately in our Institute’s conference on consciousness organized in San Francisco, 1990. He calls the dendritic bundles as dendrons and defines them as sites where microneural events interact with unitary mental events. He proposed that each of the 40 million dendrons (the dendritic bundles) is linked with a mental unit called a psychon, representing the unitary conscious experience.
As stated earlier, the biological forms impose a limitation in the development of consciousness. Therefore, different degrees of consciousness are expressed through these different bodies (see figure 8). Vedanta divides the degrees of consciousness into five broad categories: äcchädita (covered), sankucita (shrunken), mukulita (budding), vikasita (blooming) and pürëavikasita (fully bloomed).
Trees and plants, for example, are almost inert. They fall into the category of ‘covered consciousness’. However, when we observe them carefully, we see that they have a limited consciousness. Jagadish Chandra Bose reported that plants have consciousness.41 Other living entities, such as worms, insects, and other animals are in ‘shrunken consciousness’. They are not as covered as plants, but their consciousness is not fully developed either.

Human beings have ‘budding consciousness’. A bud appears shrunken, but it has the potential to bloom into a flower. Human consciousness has similar potential. So, human beings have the innate ability to develop their consciousness to an almost unlimited extent, up to the point of knowing the Absolute Truth.
